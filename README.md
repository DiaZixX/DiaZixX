# DiaZixX

## About me :speech_balloon:

Hello, I'm a French student at the Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Informatique et de Math√©matiques Appliqu√©es ([Ensimag](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/)). 


What I like about computer science is solving algorithmic problems and optimizing my solutions. In particular, I solve problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/DiaZixX/) and take part in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).


Since I discovered Linux, I've given up Windows. I've used Debian and Arch, and I'm currently running PopOs.
